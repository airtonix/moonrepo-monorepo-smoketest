# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide explains how to set up your development environment, our contribution conventions, and the CI pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- **mise** — polyglot runtime manager (install from [mise.jdx.dev](https://mise.jdx.dev))
- **moon** — task orchestrator (managed by mise)
- **proto** — toolchain manager (managed by mise)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo and install tools:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install global moon and proto via mise:**
   ```bash
   mise use -g --pin github:moonrepo/moon
   mise use -g --pin github:moonrepo/proto
   ```

3. **Install project tools and setup:**
   ```bash
   proto install
   hk install
   moon run :setup
   ```

   This will:
   - Install all pinned tool versions (from `.prototools` and `.proto/`)
   - Set up git hooks via `hk` (linters, formatters)
   - Run project-specific setup tasks

4. **Verify everything works:**
   ```bash
   moon run :lint
   moon run :test
   moon run :build
   ```

## Development Conventions

### Use Moon tasks, not npm scripts

- **All project work** must go through `moon run` commands
- This repo uses the `no-package-scripts` linter to enforce this in `pkgs/*` (libraries and CLI tools)
- Apps in `apps/*` may proxy scripts through moon tasks for convenience
- See `moon.yml` (project root) and per-project `moon.yml` files for available tasks

**Example:**
```bash
# ✅ Correct
moon run :lint
moon run :test

# ❌ Avoid
npm run lint
npm test
```

### Proto for tool pinning

- All tool versions are declared in `.prototools` and managed by proto
- Custom plugins are in `proto/plugins/` (e.g., `hk.toml` for git hooks)
- Run `proto install` to fetch and cache tool versions

### Git hooks via hk

- Pre-commit hooks run linters and auto-fixers automatically before commit
- Hooks are configured in `hk.pkl` with linters for ESLint, Prettier, Actionlint (GitHub workflows), Pkl, and custom rules
- Run `hk check` to validate, `hk fix` to auto-fix issues

## Commit and PR title conventions

This project uses **conventional commit messages** and **semantic PR titles**.

- PR title lint is enforced by `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`.
- Contributors are expected to keep commit messages in conventional format.

Preferred format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Optional body/footer are allowed.

**Allowed types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Examples:**
- `chore(dashboard): smoke test docs update`
- `fix(api-service): handle empty request payload`
- `docs(repo): clarify release workflow behavior`

## CI Pipeline

The repository currently includes these workflows:
- `.github/workflows/pr.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`
- `.github/workflows/stale.yml`

### 1. **PR checks** (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`)

Runs on pull requests:
- sets up toolchain via `moonrepo/setup-toolchain`
- validates `counter-lib` internal-only guardrails (`private: true`, no-op package/publish)
- runs `moon run :lint`, `moon run :test`, and `moon run :build`

**Must pass before merging.**

### 2. **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

Runs on pushes to configured release branches (`master`, `release/*`):
- checks release-config drift (`.github/tasks/get-release-configs check`)
- resolves release mode (`normal` vs `hotfix`)
- runs Release Please
- computes publish matrix and dispatches `publish.yml` for released targets

### 3. **Publish targets** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)

Triggered by repository dispatch from release workflow, and manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
- validates requested target against moon projects
- runs `<target>:publish`
- writes publish summary to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
- fails fast on unknown/empty targets

Current state: several project `:publish` tasks are intentionally skeletal to validate CI flow without external deployment side effects.

### 4. **PR title lint** (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`)

Enforces semantic PR titles on pull requests.

### 5. **Stale management** (`.github/workflows/stale.yml`)

Automatically marks/closes stale issues and pull requests on schedule.

## Review process

1. Create a feature branch from the repository default branch
2. Make your changes, commit with conventional commit messages
3. Push and open a pull request
4. Ensure PR title follows semantic format (e.g., `feat: add new feature`)
5. Address any CI failures or review comments
6. PR author owns follow-up until green: fix failing checks, respond to review feedback, and push updates as needed
7. Once approved and CI passes, your PR will be merged to the repository default branch
8. The release workflow then handles release PR/publish orchestration for configured release branches

## Project structure

- **`apps/`** — runnable applications
- **`pkgs/`** — publishable and internal packages
- **`.moon/`** — moon workspace configuration
- **`.prototools`** — toolchain version pinning
- **`proto/`** — custom proto plugins
- **`.github/workflows/`** — CI/CD pipelines
